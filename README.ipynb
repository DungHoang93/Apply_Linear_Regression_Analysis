    " - Quantitative predictors\n",
    "1. Create a plot of time_seconds (vertical axis) versus age (horizontal axis). Is there a linear relationship between these variables?\n",
    "2.  Fit a linear model to predict time_seconds using the age variable\n",

    "6. the homoscedasticity assumption by plotting a the residuals against the fitted values. Is this assumption satisfied?\n",

    " - Binary categorical predictors\n",
    "1. Fit another model that predicts time_seconds based on web_browser.\n",
    "2. Print out the coefficients. What is the difference in average time spent on each browser?\n"
